# Purpose
The purpose of this project is to create an accessible, responsive, and engaging online store for Rainy Days, an e-commerce brand specializing in rain jackets. This project is part of Noroff's Frontend Development course (FED1), and is aimed at demonstrating proficiency in both HTML/CSS and JavaScript by creating a fully functioning web store that integrates with Noroff's API.


# Description
This project consists of a front-end online store that allows users to browse and shop for rain jackets, view product details, add items to a shopping cart, and complete the checkout process. It features modern design principles and ensures a user-friendly experience across devices.
The website was initially developed with HTML and CSS only and later enhanced by adding interactive functionality using JavaScript.


### Key features include:
- Home Page: Lists available products with filtering options.
- Product Page: Displays detailed information for individual products.
- Checkout Page: Shows items in the cart and allows users to proceed to the checkout process.
- Confirmation Page: Confirms the user's order with a summary after checkout.
- Loading Spinner: Provides visual feedback during API calls.

### Learning Outcomes
Throughout the development of this application, I have demonstrated the following skills:

- Responsive Design: Developing a user-friendly, responsive interface using semantic HTML and CSS without frameworks like Bootstrap.
- JavaScript & API Integration: Fetching product data from an API and dynamically generating HTML content.
- Asynchronous JavaScript: Implementing async/await for smooth data handling and user interaction.
- Error Handling: Providing user feedback during loading times and when errors occur, ensuring a smooth user experience.
- Shopping Cart Functionality: Implementing dynamic cart features like adding/removing products and checking out.
- Version Control: Using GitHub for managing code changes and project development.

### Client and Target Audience
The client, Community Science Museum, is an interactive science museum aimed at school children and families. The website is designed to appeal to children ages 7-15, providing them with an engaging, educational experience without being overly simplistic.
